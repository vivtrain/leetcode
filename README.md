# leetcode
A collection of all my data structures and algorithms practice as of July 2024.
This is in preparation for my first full-time employment opportunities after
having graduated with a bachelor's degree.

## Grind 75
I've chosen to use the [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)
problem set from the Tech Interview Handbook. In my opinion, it is a good place
to start practicing DSA questions. After doing these, I will select
miscellaneous or domain-specific questions to study.

## Nice Things
### Spinup
In the `Grind75/` directory, there is a brief script called `spinup-cpp` that
sets up a few relevant files for a small, self-contained C++ program. Usage
looks something like

```
./spinup-cpp 1 TwoSum
```

and results in the following file structure.

```
1-TwoSum/
`-- cpp
    |-- TwoSum.cpp
    |-- TwoSum.h
    |-- makefile
    `-- test.cpp
```
